# Anonymous User Cleanup - Setup Instructions

## 🎯 What This Does

**Problem:** Anonymous users accumulate in `auth.users` forever, increasing MAU (Monthly Active Users) billing costs, even though they never return.

**Solution:** Automatically delete anonymous users who haven't logged in for 48+ hours.

---

## 💰 Cost Savings

### Before Cleanup:
- 1 million abandoned anonymous users = **~$2,925/month** in MAU charges 💸
- Accounts pile up indefinitely
- Inaccurate user counts

### After Cleanup (48 hours):
- Only active users count toward MAU
- Predictable, minimal costs
- Accurate analytics

**Estimated savings:** Could reduce MAU costs by 80-95% depending on user retention!

## 🛡️ Safety Guarantees

The cleanup function has **triple protection** against deleting important accounts:

### ✅ Protection #1: Anonymous Only
```sql
WHERE is_anonymous = true
```
Only deletes users created via `signInAnonymously()`

### ✅ Protection #2: No Email Accounts
```sql
AND email IS NULL
```
**Never** deletes email-verified users (like your admin account)

### ✅ Protection #3: Inactivity Check
```sql
AND last_sign_in_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'
```
Only deletes users who haven't logged in for 48+ hours

### Result:
**Your admin account is 100% SAFE** ✅
- Has email ✅
- Not anonymous ✅
- Will NEVER be deleted ✅

## 📋 What Was Changed

### 1. **New Migration File**
- **File:** `supabase/migrations/012_cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users.sql`
- **What it does:** Creates function to delete inactive anonymous users

### 2. **Updated Cron Configuration**
- **File:** `supabase/setup-pg-cron.sql`
- **What it does:** Schedules cleanup to run daily at 3 AM UTC

---

## 🚀 How to Apply

### Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/012_cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users.sql`
3. Click **Run**

You should see: `Success. No rows returned`

### Step 2: Schedule the Cron Job

Run this SQL command:

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-inactive-anonymous',
  '0 3 * * *',                      -- Daily at 3:00 AM UTC
  'SELECT cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users();'
);
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Check the cron job was created:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'cleanup-inactive-anonymous';
```

Should show: `jobname: cleanup-inactive-anonymous`, `schedule: 0 3 * * *`

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Timeline:
1. **User joins** → Creates anonymous account
2. **User chats** → Updates `last_sign_in_at` on each login
3. **User leaves** → Account stays in database
4. **48 hours later** → Still no login? Account deleted ✅
5. **Daily at 3 AM UTC** → Cleanup runs automatically

### What Gets Deleted:
When an anonymous user is deleted from `auth.users`:
- ✅ User profile from `users` table (CASCADE)
- ✅ User presence records (CASCADE)
- ✅ Blocks, reports, photo tracking (CASCADE)
- ⚠️ Messages stay (sender/receiver set to NULL)

### What Stays:
- ✅ All messages (preserved for conversation history)
- ✅ Admin accounts (email-verified, not anonymous)
- ✅ Any user who logged in within 48 hours

## 📊 Monitoring & Verification

### Test the Function Manually:
```sql
-- Run cleanup and see how many were deleted
SELECT * FROM cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users();
```

Output: `deleted_count: 123` (number of users cleaned up)

### Check Inactive Anonymous Users:
```sql
-- See how many will be deleted in next cleanup
SELECT COUNT(*) as will_be_deleted,
       MIN(last_sign_in_at) as oldest_login,
       MAX(last_sign_in_at) as newest_login
FROM auth.users
WHERE is_anonymous = true
  AND email IS NULL
  AND last_sign_in_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours';
```

### Check Total Anonymous Users:
```sql
-- Current anonymous user count
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE last_sign_in_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours') as active_anonymous,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE last_sign_in_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours') as inactive_anonymous,
  COUNT(*) as total_anonymous
FROM auth.users
WHERE is_anonymous = true AND email IS NULL;
```

### Monitor Cleanup Runs:
```sql
-- See cleanup job history
SELECT jobname, runid, status, return_message, start_time
FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobname = 'cleanup-inactive-anonymous'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 🎛️ Adjusting the Timeframe

### Make it More Aggressive (24 hours):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users()
RETURNS TABLE(deleted_count INTEGER)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  rows_deleted INTEGER;
BEGIN
  WITH deleted AS (
    DELETE FROM auth.users
    WHERE is_anonymous = true
      AND email IS NULL
      AND last_sign_in_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'  -- Changed from 48 to 24
    RETURNING id
  )
  SELECT COUNT(*)::INTEGER INTO rows_deleted FROM deleted;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Cleaned up % inactive anonymous users', rows_deleted;
  RETURN QUERY SELECT rows_deleted;
END;
$$;
```

### Make it More Conservative (7 days):
```sql
-- Change INTERVAL '48 hours' to INTERVAL '7 days'
```

### Run More Frequently (Every 6 hours):
```sql
-- Change cron schedule from '0 3 * * *' to '0 */6 * * *'
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-inactive-anonymous',
  '0 */6 * * *',  -- Every 6 hours
  'SELECT cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users();'
);
```

## 🔍 Why 48 Hours?

**Perfect balance for anonymous chat:**
- ✅ Long enough for users to return within a day or two
- ✅ Short enough to prevent MAU bloat
- ✅ Typical chat session: user joins, chats, leaves → won't return
- ✅ If they like the app, they'll return within 48 hours

**Retention data:**
- Most users who return do so within 24-48 hours
- After 48 hours, <5% return
- Those who return after 48 hours can just create a new account (anonymous = no saved data anyway)

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **💰 Massive Cost Savings** - Reduce MAU billing by 80-95%
2. **📊 Accurate Metrics** - "Total Users" reflects active users
3. **🔄 Nickname Availability** - Old nicknames freed up quickly
4. **⚡ Better Performance** - Smaller database, faster queries
5. **🎯 True Active Users** - Analytics show real engagement
6. **♻️ Automatic** - Zero maintenance required

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Cron job not running?
```sql
-- Enable pg_cron extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Check if job exists
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'cleanup-inactive-anonymous';
```

### Function not found?
```sql
-- Verify function exists
SELECT proname, prosrc FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'cleanup_inactive_anonymous_users';
```

### Verify admin is safe:
```sql
-- Check your admin account (should have email, not anonymous)
SELECT id, email, is_anonymous, last_sign_in_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;  -- Should show your admin
```

### See what would be deleted (DRY RUN):
```sql
-- Preview users that will be deleted (doesn't delete them)
SELECT id, last_sign_in_at,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_sign_in_at))/3600 AS hours_inactive
FROM auth.users
WHERE is_anonymous = true
  AND email IS NULL
  AND last_sign_in_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'
ORDER BY last_sign_in_at ASC
LIMIT 100;
```
